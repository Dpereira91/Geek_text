	It's that time of year again: the weather is getting chillier, the days are getting 
	shorter, and there's nothing better than snuggling up and getting a good read. Even 
	if you haven't picked up a book since The Fourth of July, fear not; we've gone 
	through all the best titles and come up with a few best sellers	that will keep you 
	entertained. Happy reading!
