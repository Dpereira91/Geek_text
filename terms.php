You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your account, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password.

<br>
<b>REVIEWS, COMMENTS, COMMUNICATIONS, AND OTHER CONTENT</b>
<br>
<br>
You may post reviews, comments, photos, videos, and other content; send e-cards and other communications; and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions, or other information, so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights (including publicity rights), or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable, and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam" or unsolicited commercial electronic messages. You may not use a false e-mail address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of a card or other content. GeekText reserves the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit such content, but does not regularly review posted content.
<br>
<br>
If you do post content or submit material, and unless we indicate otherwise, you grant GeekText a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, perform, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such content throughout the world in any media. You grant GeekText and sublicensees the right to use the name that you submit in connection with such content, if they choose. You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content that you post; that the content is accurate; that use of the content you supply does not violate this policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity; and that you will indemnify GeekText for all claims resulting from content you supply.

<br>
<br>
<b>COPYRIGHT COMPLAINTS</b>
<br>
<br>
GeekText respects the intellectual property of others. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please follow our Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement
<br>
<br>
<b>RISK OF LOSS</b>
<br>
<br>
All purchases of physical items from GeekText are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.
<br>
<br>
<b>RETURNS, REFUNDS AND TITLE</b>
<br>
<br>
GeekText does not take title to returned items until the item arrives at our fulfillment center. At our discretion, a refund may be issued without requiring a return. In this situation, GeekText does not take title to the refunded item. For more information about our returns and refunds, please see our Returns Center .
<br>
<br>
<b>PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS</b>
<br>
<br>
GeekText attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, GeekText does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of any GeekText Service is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by GeekText itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition.
<br>
<br>
<b>PRICING</b>
<br>
<br>
"List Price" means the suggested retail price of a product as provided by a manufacturer, supplier, or seller. We regularly check List Prices against prices recently found on GeekText and other retailers. Certain products may have a "Was Price" displayed, which is determined using recent price history of the product on GeekText.
<br>
<br>
With respect to items sold by GeekText, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If the correct price of an item sold by GeekText is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Other merchants may follow different policies in the event of a mispriced item.
<br>
<br>
We generally do not charge your credit card until after your order has entered the shipping process or, for digital products, until we make the digital product available to you.
<br>
<br>
<b>APP PERMISSIONS</b>
<br>
<br>
When you use apps created by GeekText, such as the GeekText App or Kindle App, you may grant certain permissions to us for your device. Most mobile devices provide you with information about these permissions. To learn more about these permissions, click here.
<br>
<br>
<b>SANCTIONS AND EXPORT POLICY</b>
<br>
<br>
You may not use any GeekText Service if you are the subject of U.S. sanctions or of sanctions consistent with U.S. law imposed by the governments of the country where you are using GeekText Services. You must comply with all U.S. or other export and re-export restrictions that may apply to goods, software (including GeekText Software), technology, and services.
<br>
<br>
<b>OTHER BUSINESSES</b>
<br>
<br>
Parties other than GeekText operate stores, provide services or software, or sell product lines through the GeekText Services. In addition, we provide links to the sites of affiliated companies and certain other businesses. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant, the offerings of any of these businesses or individuals (including the content of their Web sites). GeekText does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product, and content of all these and any other third parties. You should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use.
<br>
<br>
<b>DISPUTES</b>
<br>
<br>
Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any GeekText Service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by GeekText or through GeekText.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.
<br>
<br>
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.
<br>
<br>
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304, Tumwater, WA 98501. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, GeekText will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
<br>
<br>
We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
<br>
<br>
<b>APPLICABLE LAW</b>
<br>
<br>
By using any GeekText Service, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Washington, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and GeekText.
<br>
<br>
<b>SITE POLICIES, MODIFICATION, AND SEVERABILITY</b>
<br>
<br>
Please review our other policies, such as our pricing policy, posted on this site. These policies also govern your use of GeekText Services. We reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, Service Terms, and these Conditions of Use at any time. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.
